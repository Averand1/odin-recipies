    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      My grandmother makes this breakfast strata every Christmas morning, and
      it's amazing. My husband hates eggs and he always has seconds, even my 1-
      and 2-year-olds gobble this up. Perfect for breakfast, lunch, or dinner!
      Ingredients are forgiving; add your favorites or spice it up. Just make
      sure your veggies are not going to water it down.
